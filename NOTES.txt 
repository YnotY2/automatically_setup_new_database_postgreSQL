Okay so the code "create_postgresql_new_user.py" works as intended and creates the new user
and corresponding password correctly. Please note the following about the code tho;

+The code is not 100% automatic as we still need to enter the postgreSQL password. Which is fine.
*Only run this code once when setting up the project_review_tool, or for any project for that matter.
Running this will create the user, database, modify "pg_config" postgreSQl file.



Okay so now the code "create_database_and_confirm_creation.py" also fully works.
This code is actually fully automatic :D

Now we will have to modift the pga_hba.conf config file for PostgreSQL authentication, we will
add a entry of the new user to be able to modify the coresponding database :))

1, stop postgresQL service
2, add entry to pg_hba.conf file
3, restart the postgreSQl service

** For the code "edit_pg_hba_postgresql_config_file.py"
we must run it in root to be able to edit the "pg_hba.conf" postgresql file

Okay I have successfully added the line to the authentication file!
- It is added right under the default "local   all       postgres             md5" file :D

Next we will create the database schema it's self for the created database :)






Next we will verify the creation of new user and also creation of permissions of user to the corresponding
new database and schema  ;D

After that we can finaly proceed to creation the database schema !!!


-After running this complete project/program code 1X! We should be able to connect to our newly created db just fine.


*****MUST CREATE A SH SCRIPT THAT ENSURES ALL FILES HAVE CORRECT PERMISSIONS, RUN THIS SCRIPT IN ROOT*****
+++++FOLLOWING FILES;
-All python3 services within services_python3/
-All Sh services within services_sh/
-PostgreSQL pg_hba.conf file /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf

WELP NEVERMIND, SIMPLY RUN THE CODE AS SUPER USER!! AKA ROOT.
(still give privledges to sh and python3 files just in case lol)
